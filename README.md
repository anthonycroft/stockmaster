# stockmaster
This project was part of our Front-End development Bootcamp. 
This was a group project, where we learnt how to use gitHub and Git for projects when we work within a team. 
We had the following requirements:
- Use Bootstrap.
- Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
- Be interactive (in other words, accept and respond to user input).
- Use at least two server-side APIsLinks to an external site..
- Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
- Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
- Be responsive.
- Have a polished UI.
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, and so on).
Have a quality README (including a unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to the deployed application).

Our project called Stockmaster. This is an application which makes able its user to 
- build a portfolio
- Store that portfolio
- Manually delete the portfolio
- Follow the changes on the Stock market
- With the help of our visualisation tools, the user will be able to make more considerate decisions about their portfolios. 
We used the Agile development's principles.

We used the following resources:

There are parts in the project which we had no time to finish, but we would like to carry on with working on them:
- The portfolio input field could be able to validate against the available stocks on the market
- We wanted to use more visualisation tools, such as: 
  Visualise this as a doughnut or a pie chart using weighting the stocks as sectors of the chart
  Add the ability to the user to edit or delete a portfolio
- Have radio buttons which would allow the user to choose a period to analyse the portfolio
